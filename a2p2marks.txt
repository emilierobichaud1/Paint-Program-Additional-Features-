Architecture 2/10

	COMMENTS: There is no discernible attempt to implement these design patterns!
	This was a requirement of the assignment.

	Strategy Forwarding 0/2
		Check PaintPanel/ShapeChooserPanel event handlers

		2/2 Mouse events sent directly to the strategy implementing the mouse handlers
		1/2 PaintPanel mouse events forwarded to the installed strategy
		
	Strategy Hierarchy: 0/2
		Check strategy classes

		2/2 Simple, clear, focused strategy hierarchy.
		1/2 Strategy hierarchy, but not simple, clear 
		
	Factory 0/2
		YN uses factory design pattern someplace (strategy, or shape, or ...)
		YN Factory used to return a strategy, installed strategy
			in paint panel.
		
	Command 2/4
		Check PaintPanel.paintComponent, check command hierarchy.
		Note: You can only get marks for 1,2 or 1,3,4,5 for a max of 4

Y Git history looks straightforward


Members: Each member is given a fraction of the total amount of work
	for the project. This is based on the userstories they worked on.
	If all members appeared to work the same amount, each gets 25% out of 100.
	So, if all members contribute equally, each gets 25/25.

us/19 = user stories mark, sg/5 = scrumgroup mark, git/4 = git mark, ar/10 = architecture mark, af = additional features points
raw mark/60 = 60% of final grade; calculated as 5% base user stories, 15% git and scrum, 35% architecture, 5% for having at least 5 additional feature marks
rel mark/20 = 20% of final grade; us+sg+af scaled against the rest of the class
pct/100 = percentage of contribution made to group
ind mark/20 = 20% of final grade; raw+rel scaled by pct
